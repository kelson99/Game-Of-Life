Conways Game of life is a cellular automaton. Invented by John Horton Conway, it's evolution is determined by it's initial state. 

<h1>The Rules</h1>
1 - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2 - Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3 - Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4 - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
